### Note 
Because of the uncertainty about how the Aeon file format will be developed further, and because of fundamental difficulties, this project is on hold. Independently of this project, I have provided two other tools that link [yWriter](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) to timelines:

- [aeon2yw](https://peter88213.github.io/aeon2yw/): Generate a yWriter project from an Aeon Timeline 2 csv export.
- [yw-timeline](https://peter88213.github.io/yw-timeline/): Synchronize yWriter with [Timeline](http://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/).

* [yWriter](http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) synchronization
* ODT export for [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org)/[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org)
* Template based html export
